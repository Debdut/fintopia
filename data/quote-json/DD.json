It operates through three segments: Electronics \u0026 Industrial, Mobility \u0026 Materials, and Water \u0026 Protection. The Electronics \u0026 Industrial segment supplies materials and printing systems to the advanced printing industry; and materials and solutions for the fabrication of semiconductors and integrated circuits addressing front-end and back-end of the manufacturing process. This segment also provides semiconductor and advanced packaging materials; dielectric and metallization solutions for chip packaging; and silicones for light emitting diode packaging and semiconductor applications; permanent and process chemistries for the fabrication of printed circuit boards to include laminates and substrates, electroless, and electrolytic metallization solutions, as well as patterning solutions, and materials and metallization processes for metal finishing, decorative, and industrial applications. In addition, it offers various materials to manufacture rigid and flexible displays for organic light emitting diode, and other display applications, as well as provides high performance parts, and specialty silicone elastomers, and lubricants. The Mobility \u0026 Materials segment provides engineering resins, silicone encapsulants, pastes, filaments, and advanced films to engineers and designers in the transportation, electronics, renewable energy, industrial, and consumer end-markets. The Water \u0026 Protection segment provides engineered products and integrated systems for worker safety, water purification and separation, transportation, energy, medical packaging and building materials. The company was formerly known as DowDuPont Inc. and changed its name to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. in June 2019. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.","search":["d","dd","du","dup","dupo","dupon","dupont","dupont ","dupont d","dupont de","dupont de ","dupont de n","dupont de ne","dupont de nem","dupont de nemo","dupont de nemou","dupont de nemour","dupont de nemours","dupont de nemours,","dupont de nemours, ","dupont de nemours, i","dupont de nemours, in","dupont de nemours, inc","dupont de nemours, inc."],"ipoDate":"2017-09-01","sector":"Basic Materials","exchangeShort":"NYSE","isStatic":true,"symbol":"DD","currency":"USD","industry":"Specialty Chemicals"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/quote/[symbol]","query":{"symbol":"DD"},"buildId":"Njk4sJo_1dBWR55wHuASm","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}
